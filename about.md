Hi!

This website is still not finished and it will be finished soon, but here is some basic information:

Quickly about me: My name is Osman Hajiyev and I am an undergraduate student in the University of British Columbia majoring in Computer Science. I am guilty of being passionate about a lot of things within the field of computer science. When I was a kid I never thought it was possible to love work but I love what I do, I love what I am studying. I am thankful I was lucky enough to find the work I love doing. 

Passions: Computer Science, coding

Hobbies: Football (Soccer), Skiing, Cooking

I love Canada (and also USA, but I guess I love Canada more since I am living here right now) and I am very thankful for living and studying in such a great country. Canada's culture, people and identity is among the best in the world.
