Hi!

Quickly about me: My name is Osman Hajiyev and I am an undergraduate student in the University of British Columbia majoring in Computer Science. I am guilty of being passionate about a lot of things within the field of computer science. When I was a kid I never thought it was possible to love work but I love what I do, I love what I am studying. I am thankful I was lucky enough to find the work I love doing. 

Passions: Computer Science, coding

Hobbies: Football (Soccer), Skiing, Cooking
